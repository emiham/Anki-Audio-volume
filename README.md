Small [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) addon to adjust the volume of card
audio.

Frankly I think [this](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2123044452) addon is
probably better, it just happened to be created between the time I decided to
write this addon and the time I actually got to writing it. Also it hasn't been
updated for Qt6 yet, while this one has.

For now it's only tested with mpv on Linux for Anki >= 23.10. If you run into
problems on another platform, please open an issue and I'll see what I can do.
